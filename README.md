Describe what you are trying to build, why do you want to build it, what it will be useful for, how it will be used, etc. 
We are going to build a program that allows the user to verse a computer in a game of tic tac toe. Want to challenge ourselves in building this code, as we have not built a program this big before. We also think that this would be a fun program to make. Its use will be that it is fun and entertaining to do between a group of people


(Important) Draw initial UML class diagram.(cannot draw boxes but follws the UML diagram)
TicTacToe
board: char[ ][ ]
currentPlayer: char
main(args: String[ ])
printBoard(board)
isValidMove(board, row, col)
isGameFinished(board, player)
getWinner(board)
isBoardFull(board)



Plan and estimate of effort.
Plan out group meetings and work options to slowly and efficiently develop the application. We will start with creating the tic tac toe board for users to play on, while also creating two players for the game. Once we are comfortable with the board and player greetings, we will start to implement columns and row options for the player, where the code will be able to scan each row and column for the user to choose from. We will need to develop code on whether the game ended in a win or stalemate for the users, and to check if the board is full with O and X. The most difficult part of the code that we will have will be allowing the user to choose spots on the tic tac toe board to choose from in order to win the game. Overall, it will take a few meetings to complete this project. Would estimate around 5 to 8 different meeting times, but will be completed perfectly in roughly 3 Â½ weeks
