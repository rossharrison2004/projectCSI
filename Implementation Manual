Hangman Implementation Manual
  This Hangman Game is a JavaFX application that allows users to play the classic word-guessing game. The game features a graphical representation of a gallows and a hanging man. Users can input letters to guess the hidden word, and the game provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses.
